				<h3>My Story</h3>
				<p>Dr. Tara Jenkins is a native of Jackson, TN. After failing a 12th grade course that prevented her from participating in her high school graduation, her educational journey became one of resilience and determination. She is now a 1997 graduate of Clark-Atlanta University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communications. She is a 1999 graduate of Moody Bible Institute with a Master of Arts degree in Biblical Studies. Then, in December 2005, she became a graduate of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary with a Doctorate of Education in Leadership. Her dissertation topic was “The Identification of Essential Components for Equipping Pastors’ Wives for Ministry.”</p>

				<p>Jenkins is a dedicated wife, mother and leader. Jenkins has been married for fifteen years to Pastor Charles Jenkins, pastor of the historic Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church of Chicago, which was founded by the legendary Dr. Clay Evans. As the First Lady of the over 7,000 member congregation, Jenkins provides leadership to the Daughters of Royalty Women’s Ministry. She is the proud mother of three beautiful children, Princess Alexandria, Paris Victoria and Charles Jenkins III.</p>

				<p>Because God has equipped Jenkins with diverse giftings, she serves others in a multiplicity of ways. Jenkins is the founder of Ministry Mates, an organization designed to minister to Senior Pastors’ wives. Through exciting monthly gatherings, pastors’ wives’ impact is strengthened as their influence is broadened.</p>

				<p>Jenkins has also launched the Ministry Mates Institute for Online Learning which has quickly established itself as the empowerment headquarters for Pastors’ wives! Jenkins is the author of “Wisdom for Wives: 21 Things Every Pastor’s Spouse Should Know” and “Moments with the Master: 21 Meditations to Jumpstart Your Devotional Life.”  In her spare time, she enjoys offering professional voiceover services. Her voice has been heard on radio spots for Wal-Mart, Toyota and many more. She lives by the statement, “Strive to be at the top, because the bottom is overcrowded!”</p>
